List of improvements for provided account class:

1. Rather than using raw collection at "ArrayList transactionList = new ArrayList();" 
we should consider using List<-Object-> "List<Transaction> transactionList = new ArrayList<>();"

2. Return type for "getTransactions()" should also be modified to avoid using raw collection.

3. try catch block can be equipped with finally where any open connections like db can be closed. 
Alternatively we can consider using try-with-resources.

4. Method "createTimestampAndExpirydate()" can be eliminated to avoid using extra memory space for String[] rather values to transaction timestamp and Expiry can be set directly.

5. Remove unused methods like : fixDescription().

6. avoid comparing methods for value comparion in case of overriden equals() method also "==" should not be used for string comparision. 
"return o.getAccountNumber() == getAccountNumber();" can be written as "return o.accountNumber.equals(this.accountNumber);"

7. Additionally overriding equals() can be skipped in this scenario as it is useful for object comparision.

6. As transactions for any particular accountNo can be huge, adding pagination, limit, offset and sorting will be benificial for fast data retrieval.

7. In addition to above, date range can be added for fetching data for limited time rather than getting entire data every time.

8. Variable "dbTransactionList" can be changed to List<DbRow> instead of List which further can be used for iteration using for each loop.

9. The conversion from double to float for "currencyAmountInEuros" can result in loss of precision.

10. Class name should be in PascalCase (Account).

11. Remove commented code until it provides meaningful context.

12. Avoid using magic numbers instead use Constant for currency conversion (currencyAmountInPounds * 1.10).
